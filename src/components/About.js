            Hey strong women! Menstruated is a platform where we all unite to
            share our first-period stories, feelings, emotions through blogs.
            You can track your periods and get notified early through the mail.
            You should know that you are not alone in the fight against pcods
            by-polls. You can know the myths/facts, self-care during periods,
            and much much more! You go, girls.
